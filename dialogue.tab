s1scene6_ef336809	s	Yes, I was told that. But apparently, they forgot to tell me that I'm the only one in this school who's forbidden to fool around with magic.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1290	s "[what]"
s1scene6_6cf9cc8a	n	Class: Ha...	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1296	n "[what]"
s1scene6_119ce0b7	schoolgirl1	He's actually cool!	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1302	schoolgirl1 "[what]"
s1scene6_79b67f5b	s	Well. You're all thinking now that I'm not one of you. And that I'll never be one of you. Well, know this - I don't intend to be. And I'm not hoping we'll become friends. Let's just not bother each other.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1308	s "[what]"
s1scene6_beffea09	student1	Who does he think he is! I'll put him in his place.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1314	student1 "[what]"
s1scene6_340336d3	ps	(whispers) Teach him a lesson after classes today. And I'll treat you to a good steak.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1320	ps "[what]"
s1scene6_2077e818	student1	Alright. I'll gather the guys. We'll shut up this upstart. It's beef steak, right?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1326	student1 "[what]"
s1scene7_f81d6b51	sm	No matter how crappy the people in this school are, the lessons here are really on another level. It wasn't easy...	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1332	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_3aa2aed6	sm	Oh, they're already waiting for me. Didn't expect to become so interesting to them on the first day. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1338	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_d27223ff	n	Sam was thrown back several meters by a strong energy blast. He hit his back against the school fence. The magical protection of the fence sharply burned his back.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1344	n "[what]"
s1scene7_fb9a8fdc	sm	Damn! That was unexpected!	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1350	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_e55505c3	s	Aren't bad guys supposed to give a long ceremonial speech before a fight?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1356	s "[what]"
s1scene7_1e12a06c	ps	Hit him again! Seems he didn't get it the first time.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1362	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_90cb61db	sm	This is clearly their leader. Familiar face. I definitely saw him when I was reading about the school. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1368	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_d5347582	sm	Gather all energy... Raise, concentrate, amplify. Take the power of stones. Is there metal nearby? The fence... Will do. Take the power of metal. Now into the eyes... Wall... Ready. Just don't blink.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1374	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_f19a609e	student1	Three, two, one... Let's fry him!	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1380	student1 "[what]"
s1scene7_d46406da	n	The guys were hit by the reflected energy blast from the energy wall and scattered in different directions. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1386	n "[what]"
s1scene7_19c52c9f	student1	What is this? Black magic?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1392	student1 "[what]"
s1scene7_2f4f9ee0	s	You're so bad you can't even tell black from white? 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1398	s "[what]"
s1scene7_29a9deb3	sm	I remembered. He's the president's ninth son, his fourteenth child. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1404	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_304eb6c2	s	So this is how the president's children have fun. Great story for the news. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1410	s "[what]"
s1scene7_b74c63bd	ps	What, the three of you can't handle this trash? 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1416	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_3e0bcf73	sm	Now is definitely not the time to blink! 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1422	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_b59f63fe	sm	He managed to break through the wall... 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1428	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_465b364c	s	Congratulations! You're not weak. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1434	s "[what]"
s1scene7_c0409f7c	sm	Did his friends hit simultaneously with him? This is definitely the energy of several people... 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1440	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_91fc26d3	ps	What, scared? I'm being nice today. Just leave this school. And I'll forget about your existence. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1446	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_4db69b61	s	But you know, there's something strange. That was the energy of three different people. And it's not your friends. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1452	s "[what]"
s1scene7_87f1a1b7	ps	...	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1458	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_f91a471a	s	How did you obtain these energies?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	598	s "[what]"
s1scene7_7cbdfa7c	ps	What nonsense are you talking about? You think you can distinguish energy bases? You think anyone will check this? 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1464	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_97921186	s	You still don't believe me? Okay. Come on, hit me again. 	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1470	s "[what]"
s1scene7_12797191	n	This time Sam was hit by an even stronger wave, he allowed it, but tried to soften the blow.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1476	n "[what]"
s1scene7_7c1e9658	s	Thanks! Now I had time to figure it out.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1482	s "[what]"
s1scene7_7c6f6ca8	s	One energy is from a young guy, kind and pure.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1488	s "[what]"
s1scene7_2ba63c30	extend	One energy is from a middle-aged woman, she was in despair, all her energy consists of tears...	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1494	extend "[what]"
s1scene7_aa63cd47	extend	And also the energy of an adult man... Two of them clearly developed their energy not through licensed methods.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1500	extend "[what]"
s1scene7_5c9929e0	sm	I instinctively reflected the attack. I needed to let the hit through to feel its energy. But it would be stupid to ask to be hit again. They'll think I want to become a punching bag.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1506	sm "[what]"
s1scene7_debf5b9b	s	Those were definitely several different bases.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1512	s "[what]"
s1scene7_6b810916	ps	Who are you? Who told you about this? I personally know everyone in this world who can distinguish energy bases. So there must be a rat among them...	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1518	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_fb564f0c	s	Obviously, you don't know everyone. Better stay away from me. Otherwise, I won't keep quiet.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1524	s "[what]"
s1scene7_e0cfedfc	ps	Oh, and who will you tell? Your mommy? Though, I heard you don't have one. You won't last a month here. I'll do everything to get you expelled as soon as possible.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1530	ps "[what]"
s1scene7_9d1a1d86	s	You've clearly been very interested in me. Even in my parents... I think now you're even more interested in me.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1536	s "[what]"
s1scene8_9e7820a6	s	Dad, can someone take another person's energy basis for themselves?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1542	s "[what]"
s1scene8_9df208ce	d	Do you think your mom died because you took her energy?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1548	d "[what]"
s1scene8_0865c49b	d	Ah, you're growing up and, probably, you think I might have been lying to comfort a small child?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1554	d "[what]"
s1scene8_1d4f3c9a	extend	 No one can take someone else's energy for themselves.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1560	extend "[what]"
s1scene8_c4f65c53	s	Can someone intentionally give away their energy?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1566	s "[what]"
s1scene8_740bbaf9	d	That's as impossible as stopping your own heart by willpower. Our life energy is part of us. No one can get rid of it on their own.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1572	d "[what]"
s1scene8_8ae4101f	d	Believe me, it was all accidental. Your mom wanted to support your life force with her energy, but at that moment her heart stopped.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1578	d "[what]"
s1scene8_2384bfce	s	So if you kill someone while they're using their energy, you can get their energy for yourself?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1584	s "[what]"
s1scene8_51831ef8	d	What terrible questions you're asking.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1590	d "[what]"
s1scene8_1fc6186c	s	Still.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1596	s "[what]"
s1scene8_a61e2fd8	d	People with two energies are so rare that many consider their existence a myth.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1602	d "[what]"
s1scene8_5280ee68	d	I asked your grandmother how this could happen. She thought the energy transferred to you because you had just been born, and your own energy hadn't completely separated from your mom's yet.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1608	d "[what]"
s1scene8_8e45be3b	s	But I'm not the first child in the world whose mother died after childbirth.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1614	s "[what]"
s1scene8_e3fd6198	d	Not the first. But your mom could support others' life energy, just like your grandmother. It's a very rare skill.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1620	d "[what]"
s1scene8_b2bcf729	d	I think that, possibly, in the whole world only they two truly possessed this ability.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1626	d "[what]"
s1scene8_70c7abbe	d	The rest are just frauds. So the world probably doesn't know of any other similar cases.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1632	d "[what]"
s1scene8_f844fe56	s	The world doesn't know about my case either.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1638	s "[what]"
s1scene8_0862df83	d	That's for your sake. I told you how much they bothered your mom, trying to convince her to work in the king's life and health preservation team.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1644	d "[what]"
s1scene8_f53f17d2	d	More precisely, it's hard to call it work. They force people to serve them, they threaten them.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1650	d "[what]"
s1scene8_86590d1c	d	I'm sure you don't need that.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1656	d "[what]"
s1scene8_9072c041	s	They threatened her?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1662	s "[what]"
s1scene8_a27763e8	d	I didn't express myself correctly. They know how to manipulate.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1668	d "[what]"
s1scene8_70513d0b	s	So I have to hide my double energy all my life?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1674	s "[what]"
s1scene8_bfbac530	d	You can decide for yourself. You don't have to hide it. But if anyone finds out, they'll definitely have questions for you.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1680	d "[what]"
s1scene8_ab591cdb	d	But when you finish this school, you can get a license. And then you'll never have to justify your abilities again.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1686	d "[what]"
s1scene8_510f23ea	d	And you know that I'm very glad you survived? I never thought you were to blame for mom's death.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1692	d "[what]"
s1scene8_319bbd16	s	I know... But in your place, I would think differently. Thank you.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1698	s "[what]"
s1scene8_c3faea9d	sm	How does the king's son have three bases?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1704	sm "[what]"
s1scene8_7d1b986f	sm	And all three bases are clearly not his. He doesn't use his own. He's definitely not a kind guy, not a girl, and not a middle-aged man. Does he even have his own base?	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1710	sm "[what]"
s1scene8_4364b0fe	sm	He has two foreign bases. And this doesn't seem like my case anymore.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1716	sm "[what]"
s1scene8_84d20b9c	sm	Although together their power was sufficient, individually these are rather weak energies... This is all very strange.	game/tl/english/script.rpy	1722	sm "[what]"
